Since graduating from my International Business Management degree in 2020 I have been taking some self-directed learning in Javascript, Python, HTML and CSS. They have helped confirm my desire to work in technology. I am now actively looking for opportunities to start my career.

To help support myself through University I worked as a chef. This gave me a great opportunity to develop my inter-personal skills whilst applying discipline and precision to my work in what is often a high-pressure environment. I believe these skills and experience stand me in good stead for a challenging career in technology.
