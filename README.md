Hello, my name is Lucas. 
I graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University in September of 2020 with a international business management degree. Ever since I have been expanding my coding knowlegde, by undertaking online courses on CSS, Html, Javascript and Python. I have loved learning to code and building on that knowledge, and am actively looking for opportunities to continue my career in the industry.
